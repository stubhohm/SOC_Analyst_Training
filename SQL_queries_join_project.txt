Out Joines
LEFT JOIN - Returns all the left table and only the matching parts of the right table.
RIGHT JOIN - Returns all of the right tbale and only the matching parts of the left table.
FULL OUTER JOIN - Returns all columns from all called tables.

Project: Coplete a SQL Join

-Task:First, you must identify which employees are using which machines. 
    The data is located in the machines and employees tables.
    You must use a SQL inner join to return the records you need based on a connecting column. 
    In the scenario, both tables include the device_id column, which you’ll use to perform the join.
- Query: SELECT *  
FROM machines  
INNER JOIN employees ON machines.device_id = employees.device_id;
-Result: This returned the desire information with 185 postive results.


-Task: Run the following SQL query to connect the machines and employees tables through a left join.
- Query: SELECT *  
FROM machines  
LEFT JOIN employees ON machines.device_id = employees.device_id;
-Result: This returned the desire information with 200 postive results.

-Task: Run the following SQL query to connect the machines and employees tables through a RIGHT join.
- Query: SELECT *  
FROM machines  
LEFT JOIN employees ON machines.device_id = employees.device_id;
-Result: This returned the desire information with 200 postive results.

Task: To continue investigating the security incident, you must retrieve the information on all 
    employees who have made login attempts. To achieve this, you’ll perform an inner join on the employees and 
    log_in_attempts tables, linking them on the common username column.
- Query: SELECT *
FROM employees
INNER JOIN log_in_attempts ON employees.username = log_in_attempts.username;
-Result: This returned the desire information with 200 postive results.
