SELECT command allows you to specificy the columns of a table you want to view with each column header seperated by a comma. You and list specific columns or * to get all columns in a table.

FROM allows you to pick which data table you would like to reference.

ORDER BY allows you to pick a column to sort the table by as well as if you would like to 
    sort it in ascending or descending order. Multiple order requests can be made and it will order 
    the list by your first command, within entries sharing the same output as the first command, 
    sort the subsiquent group.

-WHERE can be used to filter with a boolean logic operator such as '=', '<', '>' etc this would look like 
    country = 'USA' to only return record that have a specific value.
    -A note is that not equal is '<>' not != as it is in some languages.

-LIKE can be used in place of the boolean operator sign to search for something general with % acting as a wildcard. 
    An example would be "WHERE office LIKE 'EAST%';"

-Wildcards can come in various forms
    % is a wild card of unspecified length
    _ is a wild card of length 1 meaning for each _ the results show if and only if they have the specificed text and only one addition char in the specified place.

-Boolean operator phrases such as AND, OR and NOT, can be included in a query.
    -NOTE: After a quick google it does seem that there is not an XOR operate phrase.
