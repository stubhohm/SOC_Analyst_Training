The following commands can be used as learning resources within Linux.

The first command 'whatis' returns the manual pages for the command following the 	whatis prompt. 
    	For example 'what is cat' returns cat (1) - concatenate files and print 	on the standard output.
	If I want more in detail information I can use 'man' followed by the command 	to access the manual pages of the command.

However, I may not know what command to use, but I know what I want it to achieve.
	For example, what if I wanted to print the first part or start of a file. 		This would be a use case for apropos.

The command 'apropos -a first part file' returns head (1) - output the first part 		of a file. With the simple ask and a few key words, I have found a command 	that will do exactly what I want.
